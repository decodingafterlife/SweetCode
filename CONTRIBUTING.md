## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right of [this repo](https://github.com/decodingafterlife/SweetCode) to create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### 🔄 Syncing the Fork

 Before making a Pull Request, always ensure your fork is up to date with the original repository. This helps prevent merge conflicts and keeps your changes aligned with the latest code.

You can easily sync your fork using GitHub’s web interface:
1. Go to **your forked repository** on GitHub.  
2. On the top right, just beside the green **Code** button, you'll find:
   - A **Contribute** button (with a branching icon)  
   - A **Sync fork** button (with a circular arrow icon)  
3. Click on **Sync fork** → **Update branch**  
   to pull the latest changes from the main repository into your fork.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone your forked repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SweetCode.git
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd SweetCode
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

It's good practice to create a new branch for your changes. Prfereably name the branch on the feature that you are working on:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b fixed-Groq-API-issue
```

### 5. Make Your Changes

Now make the necessary changes or additions in your code editor.

### 6. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
```

### 7. Push Changes to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Compare & pull request** button.
3. Add a title and description to your PR.
4. Click **Create pull request**.

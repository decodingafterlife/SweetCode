## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right of [this repo](https://github.com/decodingafterlife/SweetCode) to create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### üîÑ Syncing the Fork

 Before making a Pull Request, always ensure your fork is up to date with the original repository. This helps prevent merge conflicts and keeps your changes aligned with the latest code.

You can easily sync your fork using GitHub‚Äôs web interface:
1. Go to **your forked repository** on GitHub.  
2. On the top right, just beside the green **Code** button, you'll find:
   - A **Contribute** button (with a branching icon)

   to pull the latest changes from the main repository into your fork.

```

Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

cd SweetCode
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b fixed-Groq-API-issue
```

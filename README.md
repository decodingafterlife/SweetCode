## Overview
SweetCode is a browser extension designed to gamify your LeetCode practice sessions by rewarding you with social media usage time based on the difficulty of the problems you solve. Once installed, it helps you stay productive by limiting access to social media websites until your earned time runs out, resetting daily. As part of its core experience, SweetCode also features an AI Hint Assistant that provides helpful hints for LeetCode problems in exchange for your earned social media time, making your learning both focused and efficient.

**New Feature**: AI Hint Assistant - Get helpful hints for LeetCode problems in exchange for your earned social media time.

### Setup AI Hint Assistant

#### 1. Get Your Groq API Key
To use the AI Hint Assistant feature, you'll need a Groq API key:

1. **Sign up for Groq**: Visit [Groq's website](https://console.groq.com/) and create an account.
2. **Log in**: Use your credentials to access the Groq console.
3. **Navigate to API Keys**: Go to the [API Keys section](https://console.groq.com/keys) in your dashboard.
4. **Create a new key**: Click "Create API Key" and give it a descriptive name.
5. **Copy your key**: Save the generated API key securely - you'll need it for the extension.

#### 2. Configure the Extension
1. Click on the SweetCode extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2. Enter your Groq API key in the "Groq API Key" field.
3. Select your preferred AI model from the dropdown:
   - **Llama3-8b**: Fast and efficient for general hints.
   - **Gemma-9b**: Good balance of speed and quality.
   - **DeepSeek-70b**: Most advanced model for detailed hints.

**Note**: The hint buttons only appear when you're on a LeetCode problem page. The AI analyzes the problem context automatically to provide relevant hints.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: See the screenshots above for visual examples of the AI Assistant interface and hint system in action.

### Customize Social Media Websites
The extension now uses an improved helper function for better website management. To add or remove social media platforms:

1. Open the `background.js` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the `isSocialMediaMainPage` function (around line 177).
3. The function now uses a more robust pattern-matching system with better URL parsing.

To add a new social media platform, follow this pattern:

```javascript
// Add your pattern definition
const yourPlatformPattern = /^(www\.)?yourplatform\.com\/?.*/i;

// Add to the return statement
return (
  // ... existing patterns ...
  (urlObj.hostname === 'yourplatform.com' || urlObj.hostname === 'www.yourplatform.com') && yourPlatformPattern.test(urlObj.host + urlObj.pathname)
);
```

**Example**: Adding LinkedIn support:
```javascript
const linkedinPattern = /^(www\.)?linkedin\.com\/?.*/i;

return (
  // ... existing patterns ...
  (urlObj.hostname === 'linkedin.com' || urlObj.hostname === 'www.linkedin.com') && linkedinPattern.test(urlObj.host + urlObj.pathname)
);
```

The helper function automatically excludes authentication pages, login forms, and other non-content pages to provide a better user experience.

### Adjust Reward Times
1. Open the `background.js` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the `timeRewards` object:
   ```javascript
   const timeRewards = {
     'Easy': 10,
     'Medium': 20,
     'Hard': 40
   };
   ```
3. Modify the values to set your desired reward times (in minutes). For example:
   ```javascript
   const timeRewards = {
     'Easy': 5,
     'Medium': 15,
     'Hard': 30
   };
   ```
4. Save the file and reload the extension on the extensions page.

## How It Works
1. **Track LeetCode Submissions**: The extension listens for LeetCode problem submissions. When you successfully submit a problem, it checks the difficulty level.
2. **Reward Social Media Time**: Based on the problem difficulty, it adds the corresponding time to your social media allowance.
3. **AI Hint System**: When you request a hint, the extension sends the problem context to Groq's AI API and deducts time from your allowance.
4. **Allow Social Media Access**: If your time runs out, you can only access the main pages of social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter/X). Other websites remain accessible as usual.

## Notes
- Your social media time is tracked locally in your browser's storage and resets daily.
- The extension currently supports Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter/X, WebNovel, and NovelBin by default, with customization options to add others.
- The AI Hint Assistant requires an active internet connection and a valid Groq API key.
- Hint costs are deducted immediately when you request them, regardless of whether you use the hint or not.
